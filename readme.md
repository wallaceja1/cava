This map focuses on the potential relationship between the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA) and the EPI Air Quality scores of Central American countries. Central America is home to a large density of active volcanos and also consistently ranks very low in the EPI Air Quality rankings. This map displays volcanos in the CAVA as points, with each point being in one of two categories based upon height. EPI Air Quality scores are displayed as a choropleth map for each Central American country. The air quality data for this map was collected from the 2020 EPI report. This data was then manually assembled in an Excel spreadsheet and then joined to a polygon of Central American countries in QGIS. The resulting polygon was then saved as a geoJSON. The volcano data was assembled in Excel manually by the map author and converted to geoJSON. The basemap is property of Carto.
